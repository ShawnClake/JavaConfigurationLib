# JavaConfigurationLib
A quick prototyped java configuration library. Still needs some work, follow MorgenCore for details.

Notes:
- Don't use this library in production.
- Use this library only as a starting point. It has many flaws and needs changes.
- This was a quick prototyped configuration library built in VIM. As such formatting, documentation, and logic are not optimal
